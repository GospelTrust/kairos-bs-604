## Exegetical Assignment

Research and Application

<sub>Part 2</sub>
### Research and Interpretation

Choose one scriptural passage in the section of Mark 1-5, 9-10, 12-13 or Luke 11–19. Typically, the passage is 10-15 verses, though it might be slightly shorter or longer:

1. Read it many times, soak it all in, and meditate on it.

2. Fill out the chart below based on your own reading and reflections. This is your opportunity to do your own interpretation and make your own notes

3. Now that you’ve done your own reflections, it’s time to begin further research. Research your passage using Commentaries and Bible dictionaries (_not ancient ones—most should be at least written in the year 2000 or later_), then fill in the revised chart below.
   - _Do not use the Matthew Henry commentary_.

      It was written in 1706 and for some reason many students use it every semester and it has a negative impact on your grade.

   - Write a coherent paper based on the chart below and include all the elements in each section of the chart.

   - Do not deviate from your text and its immediate biblical context.

   - Do not utilize scriptures from other parts of the Bible.

5. Write a paper according to guidelines below the chart according to the instructions after the chart, including the Application Section (Part 3 below the Chart):

   Complete the Literary Elements Chart below (using literary methodology of Narrative Criticism)

   In the chart below, fill in as many of the literary elements you can find. The goal here is to bombard the text with any and all questions you can think of. Everything depends on how intently you read. In short, the better your questions, the better your research, and by extension, the better will be your final exegetical paper.

   Description | Literary Elements
   :--- | :---
   Discover the Context (Why do you begin and end here? What comes before and after the passage?) <br/>_Do not base your decision on verses, chapters, or headings—none of these are in the original Greek text of the Bible!_ |
   __Translations and Word Meanings__<br/>Consult several different translations of your passage (e.g. NRSV, NIV, RSV, NASB, ESV). Record any variant meanings/nuances and modify/ improve your interpretation based on the different nuances of the translations, _if they are significant_!<br/>Include any insights from commentaries on meanings of key words/phrases (commentaries will be consulted below in Historical Background) |
   ~~Synoptic Parallels or Intertextual References This is not required. But if helpful, list synoptic parallels only if the version differs in other gospels and explain why you think so~~ | Omit this unless you feel it is necessary to your interpretation.
   __Character(s)__<br/>List all the characters and their roles in the passage. |
   __Audience__<br/>Can you tell from the text who the audience is?That is, who is being addressed in their writing? |
   __Observe Grammar and Structure/Ask Questions__<br/> (comparison, contrast, parallelism, series, simile, metaphor, cause/effect, statement/response, irony, and so forth). Ask who, what, when, why where, how, so? See W (Wenham/Walton) p. 105. |
   __Speaker__<br/>Is there a speech or dialogue in the text? If so, who is making the speech or dialogue? |
   __Genre__<br/>What is the genre or literary category? Some sample genres are: 1) speech; 2) narrative; 3) hymn;4) parable; 5) dialogue; 6) sermon; 7) poetry; 8) prophecy; 9) prayer; 10) command, etc. |
   __Setting__<br/>Where is the passage set? What is the geographic location (i.e., on a mountain, in a plain, in a valley, near water)? Is it in a city or a village? A farm or in the wilderness? On a road? If so, where are they traveling from/to? |
   __Time__<br/>(if relevant—do not make up answer if the text does not indicate anything)! During what season of the year is the text set? What time of day? Is a holy day involved? |
   __Key Word(s), Phrase(s), or Theme(s)__<br/>List any key words, phrases, or themes. Key words, phrases, or themes are words, phrases, or themes that 1) are repeated; or 2) have significant meaning. |
   __Historical Background__<br/>Are there references to historical background that will be necessary to understand the text? Are there workers, rulers, tribal leaders, kings, or queens mentioned? Are there references to any ethnic groups? Any events? Religious leaders/issues? _Add insights from commentaries and research on historical background. Modify your interpretation appropriately._ |
   __Socio-cultural Elements__<br/>What social conventions can you identify? Does eating, drinking, dining, traveling come into play?  Who has/doesn't have power? Who is "in"? Who is "out"? How is gender or kinship structured (i.e., who is exercising power and agency and can you tell why)? Is there evidence of patronage or benefaction? Is honor or shame a factor? _Add insights from commentaries/research._ |
   Summarize your Interpretation of the Passage in a Sentence or Two (thesis statement) |
   Interpret the Content of the Passage after your research and reading of commentaries (What does it mean; don’t “skip over” puzzling things that you don’t understand--do your best to deal with difficult verses. This should be the main section of your paper). Now try to answer unanswered questions and understand what is puzzling with the help of resources |
   __Application__: does the passage state or imply how it should be applied? See Part 3 Below: |

   - KEY TIPS:
      1. Do not rely on headings in the Bible or Chapter Divisions since they were added by editors. They will only serve to short-circuit your exegesis and rob you of the joy of discovery. If you let others do the thinking for you, you have not actually performed exegesis but have provided a catalog of what others have said.
      2. Students who have carefully followed the above chart have tended to write the best quality papers and students who do not carefully follow it tend to write poor quality papers.
      3. Do not leave the book of Mark or Luke and jump around to other passages in the Bible.

### Now Write Your Paper

After completing the chart above, write a carefully
pondered, methodical paper that weaves in your findings from the chart above and continues to follow all instructions below.

6. __Your paper must include a thesis statement.__

   To craft a thesis statement, think about the text as a whole. What is this text trying to teach people in its original audience? What did the text mean for the ancient world? What is the text trying to communicate to them? How does the passage accomplish these goals?  Your answer/s to these questions will form your thesis for the paper. This should be a one-sentence statement that carefully, precisely, and succinctly makes a statement or claim about the meaning (not just the content!) of the passage. Be careful not to make a procedural statement (e.g. "The following paper will exegete the Ten Commandments."). Such a statement is implicit and need not be stated.  A thesis statement, by definition, is a claim or assertion that can be contested. __Put in bold__ this statement and place it at or near the end of your introduction.

   The thesis statement __should not__ begin thus: “In this paper, I will argue that...” Revise this sentence until you achieve clarity, economy of words, and a true introduction to the content of your paper. This will usually require your revising this sentence at least once after you have finished the rest of the paper.

   Example of a good thesis statement:

   > As he journeys toward his own death on the cross, Jesus teaches the disciples that they too must take up their cross; to live is to die and to dies to live.

Your focus must be on the historical — what might the text have meant to its ancient hearers given the ancient historical/sociological context. Save any theological reflection (that is, about what you have learned from God) for the Application portion of the paper. Don’t forget to add this:

### Application

#### Application

(`10 points`) Include at the end of your paper about 200-400 words on how this text applies to you and your community (or the contemporary world) today. In making the leap from what the text meant to what the text means, students are to ask the following questions:

- __Universal level analysis__: How does what I have learned from the passage affect the way I think about God, the world/society, the church in general?

- __Personal level analysis__: How does what I have learned from the passage affect the way I live? How does this message (or messages) challenge or encourage me personally?

```
Questions are based on Donald Hagner's discussion in, New Testament Exegesis and Research: A Guide for Seminarians (Pasadena: Fuller Seminary Press, 1992), 23.
```

Feel free to write in this Application Section in the first-person pronoun. As you do, push yourself to go beyond "I have learned a lot." Think about how the text informs your life and unique experiences. The Application portion should not be an afterthought in your exegetical analysis, but the culmination of it! This is where you work out how the message of the text gets traction in life... in your life!

The only caveat is that you remain focused on what you have learned from the text itself and your further research. Be sure that your application comments are derived directly and reasonably from the meaning of the passage.

While exegesis is primarily about determining what the text meant in its original context and to its original audience, we must not leave the matter there. It is also important to extend the text's meaning into the contemporary world. After all, the Bible is revelation for us as it was for them. In transitioning from the "then" to the "now," be careful that you do not throw off the work of observation and research. Responsible application must be an outgrowth of proper observation and research.
