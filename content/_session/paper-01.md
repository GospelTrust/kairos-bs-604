  <summary>Exegetical Paper on Luke 12</summary>
  <h3>UNPOSSESSED</h3>
  <blockquote>
    The true storehouse for our surplus is benevolence.
    <br/>— William M. Taylor (The Parables of Our Saviour, p. 269)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The Lord’s evocative parable on greed and its destructive effect on the soul of its owners is a blunt warning to his hearers; Jesus’ stern message leaves no room for misinterpretation, “Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions” (Luke 12:15, ESV). In pursuit of wealth, greed consumes its victims with an unquenchable thirst, twisting the mind inward like the Gollum, unable to break free of his lust for the ring he hated (Tolkien, 1954). Luke breaks up the Lord’s didactic discourses on fear and disquietude by using a petition to settle an inheritance dispute showing the general sentiment of anxiety within the public sphere. The parable only addresses the mortal consequences of covetousness, while Luke leaves the answer on how to be “rich toward God” (v. 21) in the later discourses. Life’s uncertainty fuels anxieties that lead us to seek security in accumulating wealth; as our worldly treasure grows, we become subservient to our possessions until we are utterly consumed — unless we seek a different kind of treasure in another realm (verses 31ff.).
  </p>

  <p>
    Luke is the only gospel that tells the story of a man entirely absorbed by the wealth that distorted his perception and understanding of Jesus and his teachings. The Lord coldly rejects the man’s petition to arbitrate on his behalf against the greedy brother. This story illustrates a cross-section of the multiplicity of sentiments representing the multitudes. The broad social stratum in the audience experiences fear and anxiety differently; the poor and rich both fear that they do not have enough yet for entirely different motivations. The poor worry they will go hungry, while the rich fear they will miss out on having more. The man in the story from the latter group worries that he will miss out on his inheritance; his request for adjudication to protect his financial interest reveals his selfish worldly preoccupations. The Lord’s admonition is still fresh in the preceding verses, “Do not be anxious about how you should defend yourself or what you should say” (v. 11); however, this discontented man is so fixated on his entitlements, his flesh is present, but his heart and mind are enslaved to the pursuit of wealth — he mistook the Savior for a small claim court judge.
  </p>

  <p>
    The gospel of Luke accentuates the disparity between the social and economic classes of the period. The beginning of the passage, where “many thousands of the people gathered together” (v. 1), consists of varying social and economic strata. Instead of directly addressing the man bearing a grudge, Jesus tells the crowd a parable about a wealthy man and his ephemeral acquisitive dream. The interruption by the man with an inheritance dispute serves as a segway for the Lord to teach the people about the emptiness of greed.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “Man, who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?”
    <br/>— Verse 14
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Luke recorded the only instance when the Lord referred to a petitioner in such cold and distant language to reveal how disconnected this man was from Jesus’ teaching of the upside-down kingdom.
  </p>

  <p>
   	The dark parable ends deathly for the rich man blessed by God (v. 16). The Gospel of Luke contrasts the making of the poor rich in God against the rich’s private obsession with wealth, depriving them of hope, relationships, and life. This parable centered around a man’s soliloquy revealing his inner avaricious motives. Upon seeing his land yield plentifully, the wealthy man thinks about capitalizing on this providential endowment. Greed overtakes his heart as a “man with an evil eye hastens after wealth and does not know that poverty will come upon him” (Prov. 28:22). The Lord reveals the man hidden thoughts, starting with a question he asks himself:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?”
    <br/>— Verse 17
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The increase in crop yield also increases his appetite for wealth as he disregards his existing storage facilities. As a recipient of God’s providential blessings, the rich man, in his abundance, must remember that he is a servant of God and is held accountable for what he was delegated: “Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand the more” (v. 48). The covetous man is consumed with capacity planning to increase the size of his holding while the poor and everyone else besides himself is ignored, or worse, taken advantage of. The Lord exposes the rich’s egocentrism in the short parable. The man, so full of himself, uses the first-person pronouns eleven times: “What shall I do,” “I have nowhere,” “my crops,” “I will do,” “I will tear down,” “my barns,” “I will store,” “my grain,” “my goods,” “I will say,” and “my soul” (verses 17-19). The only second-person pronoun used is “you” in reference to his soul; his solipsist world turns inward toward himself and his possessions — the rich fool ends up alone. The parable illustrates the paradoxical pursuit of the rich to gain possessions yet has no friends to share them, “The things you have prepared, whose will they be?” Who will give his eulogy? What will they say about this rich man? According to Luke, God has pronounced his judgment, the rich in their pursuit of greed are fools, and “so is the one who lays up treasure for himself and not rich toward God” (verses 20-21).
  </p>

  <p>
    The parable ends without explaining the meaning of being “rich toward God” (Greek: “πλουτῶν εἰς θεὸν”). The New American Standard Bible offers an alternate translation of the Greek word εἰς as “in relation to” instead of “toward.” This rendition of the word gives a clearer understanding of what it truly means to be rich. The contrast between riches as having an abundance of possessions versus having a relationship with God delineates the temporal and eternal. Luke encapsulates this dichotomy vividly two chapters after, in the parable of the prodigal son; after he squandered all his wealth, his so-called friends abandoned him, and all that remains is the son’s relationship with his father (Luke 15:17). The Lord begins the parable with the warning, “One’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions,” (v. 15) not to denounce having material things but to be aware of the deadly effect covetousness has on the soul of its victim. The man in the parable assumes God’s blessings as his to possess rather than seeing himself as God’s “faithful and wise manager” (v. 42). The rich fool dreams of tearing down his barns to build larger ones so he can make more profit during the off seasons and hopefully retire in comfort (v. 19). St. Augustine remarks on the fool’s need to build larger barns puts in perspective that God cares about people, not profits:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Thou hast barns — the bosoms of the needy, the houses of the widows, the mouths of orphans and of infants.
    <br/>— St. Augustine (Taylor, p. 268)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    After the parable, the Lord turns to his disciples to plainly instruct them about their anxiety and their desires to possess. Jesus tells them clearly, “The Father knows that you need them,” but they need to trust God’s promise that he will give them the kingdom (vv. 30ff). Luke’s gospel brings the immediacy of the kingdom into the forefront of his audience by challenging them to have faith:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    But if God so clothes the grass, which is alive in the field today, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith!
    <br/>—Verse 28
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Life’s uncertainty brings out anxiety in all of us. The need to control our destiny by securing our future with bigger storehouses is alluring but has deadly consequences. The Lord’s remark, “For you always have the poor with you” (Mat 26:11; Mark 14:7), reminds us that the Church is responsible for the widow, orphans, disenfranchised, and destitute. Jesus challenges his disciples to “sell your possessions, and give to the needy” (v. 33). Our earthly possessions are for the poor in the kingdom that is here and now; our heavenly treasures will be in God’s kingdom that is to come. The Church is entrusted with the promise that the Father has “blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places” (Eph 1:3); the Lord sets the wise to oversee the heavenly treasures to give to the poor “their portion of food at the proper time” (v. 42). While we await the Lord’s return if the Church tends to the “least of these” then we have done good unto Jesus.
  </p>

  <h3>Application</h3>
  <p>
    The world’s message is: “You don’t have enough! You must have more! Your family and future depend on you having this!” The inescapable appeal of securing your future with more and better things is sidelining Luke’s central message that Jesus was sent to preach the gospel to the poor. When we turn inward toward ourselves to find safety and security, our desires will never be satisfied because greed is an abyss of unrelenting struggles; the side effect of the Church’s neglecting the poor has spiritual consequences:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?’ Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.’ And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”
    <br/>—Matthew 25:44-46
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Ministry to the poor is not optional but central to the Church’s message, and it is the responsibility of every Christian. James puts it bluntly that our religion is defiled and polluted unless we care for “orphans and widows in their affliction” (James 1:27). The Church needs to look outward toward the kingdom, not inwardly, to preserve its resources. Living at the base level of our necessity requires God’s grace and discipline. When the Church becomes a faithful servant, entrusted to distribute (and not hoard) God’s providence to the poor, then it can begin to shine. Let not the churches build bigger barns, but bring God’s treasures out of the storehouses and distribute them to the needy.

## Exegetical Assignment

Research and Application

<sub>Part 1</sub>
### Research and Interpretation

Choose one scriptural passage in the section of Mark 1-5, 9-10, 12-13 or Luke 11–19. Typically, the passage is 10-15 verses, though it might be slightly shorter or longer:

1. Read it many times, soak it all in, and meditate on it.

2. Fill out the chart below based on your own reading and reflections. This is your opportunity to do your own interpretation and make your own notes

3. Now that you’ve done your own reflections, it’s time to begin further research. Research your passage using Commentaries and Bible dictionaries (_not ancient ones—most should be at least written in the year 2000 or later_), then fill in the revised chart below.
   - _Do not use the Matthew Henry commentary_.

      It was written in 1706 and for some reason many students use it every semester and it has a negative impact on your grade.

   - Write a coherent paper based on the chart below and include all the elements in each section of the chart.

   - Do not deviate from your text and its immediate biblical context.

   - Do not utilize scriptures from other parts of the Bible.

5. Write a paper according to guidelines below the chart according to the instructions after the chart, including the Application Section (Part 3 below the Chart):

   Complete the Literary Elements Chart below (using literary methodology of Narrative Criticism)

   In the chart below, fill in as many of the literary elements you can find. The goal here is to bombard the text with any and all questions you can think of. Everything depends on how intently you read. In short, the better your questions, the better your research, and by extension, the better will be your final exegetical paper.

   Description | Literary Elements
   :--- | :---

This should be the main section of your paper). Now try to answer unanswered questions and understand what is puzzling with the help of resources |
   __Application__: does the passage state or imply how it should be applied? See Part 3 Below: |

   - KEY TIPS:
      1. Do not rely on headings in the Bible or Chapter Divisions since they were added by editors. They will only serve to short-circuit your exegesis and rob you of the joy of discovery. If you let others do the thinking for you, you have not actually performed exegesis but have provided a catalog of what others have said.
      2. Students who have carefully followed the above chart have tended to write the best quality papers and students who do not carefully follow it tend to write poor quality papers.
      3. Do not leave the book of Mark or Luke and jump around to other passages in the Bible.

<sub>Part 2</sub>
### Now Write Your Paper

After completing the chart above, write a carefully
pondered, methodical paper that weaves in your findings from the chart above and continues to follow all instructions below.

6. __Your paper must include a thesis statement.__

   To craft a thesis statement, think about the text as a whole. What is this text trying to teach people in its original audience? What did the text mean for the ancient world? What is the text trying to communicate to them? How does the passage accomplish these goals?  Your answer/s to these questions will form your thesis for the paper. This should be a one-sentence statement that carefully, precisely, and succinctly makes a statement or claim about the meaning (not just the content!) of the passage. Be careful not to make a procedural statement (e.g. "The following paper will exegete the Ten Commandments."). Such a statement is implicit and need not be stated.  A thesis statement, by definition, is a claim or assertion that can be contested. __Put in bold__ this statement and place it at or near the end of your introduction.

   The thesis statement __should not__ begin thus: “In this paper, I will argue that...” Revise this sentence until you achieve clarity, economy of words, and a true introduction to the content of your paper. This will usually require your revising this sentence at least once after you have finished the rest of the paper.

   Example of a good thesis statement:

   > As he journeys toward his own death on the cross, Jesus teaches the disciples that they too must take up their cross; to live is to die and to dies to live.

Your focus must be on the historical — what might the text have meant to its ancient hearers given the ancient historical/sociological context. Save any theological reflection (that is, about what you have learned from God) for the Application portion of the paper. Don’t forget to add this:

<hr class='section' />

<sub>Part 3</sub>
### Application

(`10 points`) Include at the end of your paper about 200-400 words on how this text applies to you and your community (or the contemporary world) today. In making the leap from what the text meant to what the text means, students are to ask the following questions:

- __Universal level analysis__: How does what I have learned from the passage affect the way I think about God, the world/society, the church in general?

- __Personal level analysis__: How does what I have learned from the passage affect the way I live? How does this message (or messages) challenge or encourage me personally?

<pre>
Questions are based on Donald Hagner's discussion in, New Testament Exegesis and Research: A Guide for Seminarians (Pasadena: Fuller Seminary Press, 1992), 23.
</pre>

Feel free to write in this Application Section in the first-person pronoun. As you do, push yourself to go beyond "I have learned a lot." Think about how the text informs your life and unique experiences. The Application portion should not be an afterthought in your exegetical analysis, but the culmination of it! This is where you work out how the message of the text gets traction in life... in your life!

The only caveat is that you remain focused on what you have learned from the text itself and your further research. Be sure that your application comments are derived directly and reasonably from the meaning of the passage.

While exegesis is primarily about determining what the text meant in its original context and to its original audience, we must not leave the matter there. It is also important to extend the text's meaning into the contemporary world. After all, the Bible is revelation for us as it was for them. In transitioning from the "then" to the "now," be careful that you do not throw off the work of observation and research. Responsible application must be an outgrowth of proper observation and research.

#### Style, Form, and Grammar

Please follow the following style, format, and grammar expectations:

1. Page length: 2300-3000 words 1½–spaced, three-four pages. [followed by a Works Cited or Bibliography page].

2. Heading to include Name, Date, Class Name [single spaced]. Do not use a title page.

3. Font: Times New Roman 12-Point Font (Times New Roman 10 for footnotes)

4. Margins = one inch.

5. 1½ spaced [except Heading, which is single spaced].

6. Insert Page Numbers.

## Luke 12:13-21 (ESV)

> Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.” But he said to him, “Man, who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?” And he said to them, “Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.” And he told them a parable, saying, “The land of a rich man produced plentifully, and he thought to himself, ‘What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?’ And he said, ‘I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my soul, “Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.”’ But God said to him, ‘Fool! This night your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?’ So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.”

----

### Discover the Context

- Why do you begin and end here?

  Jesus was asked to arbitrate between two brothers about question of inheritance. Jesus stopped teaching the crowd and directed his answer to the inquirer.

  At the end of the parable, Jesus no longer in conversation with the man asking the question but turned to his disciples and continued to admonished them to pursue the kingdom of God.

- What comes before and after the passage?

  Jesus was teaching the crowd about not fearing man but to fear God instead and relying on the Holy Spirit for guidance. After the parable, he turned to teach his disciples to trust in the Father and set their focus on the Kingdom instead of worrying about life.

- By replacing his barns, he avoids using agricultural land for storage
  - Maximizing his income
  - Gets better pricing for his crops
- St. Augustine
  > "The redemption of a man's soul is his riches." This silly fool of a man did not have that kind of riches. Obviously he was not  redeeming his soul by giving relief to the poor. He was hoarding perishable crops. I repeat, he was hording perishable crops, while he was on the point of perishing because he had handed out nothing to the Lord before whom he was due to appear. How will he know where to look, when at that trial he starts hearing the words, "I was hungry and you did not give me to eat"? He was planning to fill his soul with excessive and unnecessary feasting and was proudly disregarding all those empty bellies of the poor. He did not realize that the bellies of the poor were much safer storerooms than his barns. What he was towing away in those barns was perhaps even then being stolen away by thieves. But if he stowed it all in the bellies of the poor, it would of course be digested on earth, but in heaven it would be kept all for the more safely. The redemption of a man's soul is his riches. (Sermon 36.9)

  > Ecclesiastics and spiritual persons ought not to meddle with secular things, but to empty themselves in divine ones, as St. Paul says, 2 Tim 2:4, "No soldier on service entangleth himself in the affairs of this life."
