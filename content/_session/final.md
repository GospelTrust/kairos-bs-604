For the final exam - review all your notes for the lectures on the Gospel of John and read the following pages in the [Wenham/Walton] book that you will also be quizzed on:

- pp. 257-269 (Kindle 525-550)
- pp. 273-278 (Kindle 558-569)

This means you will be reading the Chapter on the Gospel of John but stopping at the heading "The Sources of the Gospel" and then starting again at the heading, "John is addressing a church that has split from Judaism" and continuing to the end.
