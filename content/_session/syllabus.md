## Objectives

The goal of this course is for students to be able read and interpret the Bible with sound principles, and
so nourish themselves and others spiritually. This course will explain, emphasize, and illustrate insights
through systematic study of gospel passages in order to extract their missiological relevance for how we
understand our lives for Christian faith and practice in the world. live our lives in the world.
In particular, students who successfully complete this course will –

- Appreciate the importance of identifying the context of a passage for understanding it, and gain skill at doing so.

  (This is vital in passages like Matthew 4, Luke 4, Mark 6, John 4.)

- Be aware that not all of the language in the Bible is straight-forward. They will be able to recognize and differentiate between passages that are straight-forward versus those which have a considerable amount of figurative language, and will have a sound perspective for interpreting and applying passages whose language is figurative.

  (For example: What does Jesus mean when he says to pluck out your eye or cut off your arm if they cause you to sin?)

- Comprehend the importance of carefully determining the meaning of words in the Bible, especially significant theological terms such as "kingdom," "deliverance," and “born again.” They will have gained skill at identifying both the range of meaning which a term may have, as well as how it is being used in a specific context.

  (For example: "kingdom" in the parables, “deliverance” in Luke 4, and “born again” in John 3.)

- Come to realize that earlier events and earlier books in the Bible set the stage for understanding passages that occur later in the Bible. They will be able identify such connections and explain how that biblical background sheds light on subsequent passages in the Bible.

  (For example: Jubilee language of Jesus in Luke 4 rooted in Isaiah 61 and Leviticus 25.)

- Realize how a basic knowledge of the culture and customs of the times in which the Bible was written can help shed light on the meaning of the biblical text.

  Three examples:

  - What was Jesus’ concept of the Kingdom and why did Jesus and Roman/Jewish leaders differ on the meaning?

  - Why were Herod and Jewish leaders “disturbed” by the birth of Jesus in Matthew 2?

  - Why was a Pharisee disturbed that a woman entered his home and was anointing Jesus with an expensive jar of perfume?

The course will set forth these fundamental interpretive insights, will illustrate them from Scripture, and will give students practice on interpreting passages.

## Academic Integrity / Plagiarism

Doing Your Own Work. Students are required to do their own work. Group study and review
sessions are fine and are encouraged. But when completing an assignment or writing a paper,
students must do their own work. Similarly, when taking a quiz or an exam, whether in the classroom
or online, students are to do their own work.

##### "Closed Book" Quizzes
If a quiz or exam is "closed book," students are to take it without the aid of
their Bible, any books, reference works, or notes. [Professors will designate whether an exam is
closed book, or whether students may use their Bibles or notes, etc.] Using notes or other materials
when taking a quiz or exam that is "closed book" constitutes cheating.

##### Proper Attribution / Plagiarism
For term papers & research papers, it is expected that students will
read and use multiple sources. When referring to information that is commonly known, footnotes are
not needed. However, if students use detailed information drawn from a specific source, they must
give credit to that author; in specific, they must identify the book, author, and page # of the source. If
failure to do so is an honest oversight, as a minimum, it will reduce the grade of a paper. But if a
student passes off research done by another person as his or her own work, that is plagiarism, which
is a serious violation of academic integrity.

##### Consequences for Violations of Academic Integrity:
In the case of a violation any of the above, at the
discretion of the professor and the Academic Dean of Kairos University, based on the seriousness of
the violation, any of the following consequences may be imposed:

- The student may be required to re-accomplish the work or exam in question, or to complete a designated alternate assignment; such work will receive a maximum grade of "C".

- The student will not be given an opportunity to re-accomplish the work and will receive an "F" for the work in question. This may result in the student will receiving a grade of "F" for the course.

For repeated violations of academic integrity in more than one course, a student may be dismissed from the university.
