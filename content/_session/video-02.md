## The Interpretation of the Gospel

- Theology (understand God's word)

  > We preach the word of God, uninterrupted by human minds. (Sign in front of an An Arbor Church)

  - 50k thoughts per day 90% repeated next day
  - Always do interpretations
  - Traditions / non-tradition

  > We don't examine our beliefs, we don't admit to error, and we don't care what you think. (Sponsored by your local church, synagogue or mosque)

  - We are not flawless
  - Luke 2:10
    > καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ὁ ἄγγελος Μὴ φοβεῖσθε· ἰδοὺ γὰρ εὐαγγελίζομαι ὑμῖν χαρὰν μεγάλην, ἥτις ἔσται παντὶ τῷ λαῷ,
  - Someone interpreted into English
  - Don't be arrogant

- Key: How we approach
  - Be aware of our preconception
  - Interpret in context
  - Form of speech (hyperbole)
  - "Lord is my Shepherd" (the Lord is crazy)
    > The Lord is my pig herder

- Bible comes in historical and cultural contexts
  - "Keep oil in your lamp" or "Keep your lightbulb on"
  - Important to read books in their entirety

- Prepackaged gospel
  > Take it but don't unwrap it
  - John Baptist had doubts and asked again if Jesus was the Messiah
  - Then & Now interaction

    Nicodemus - go back and read the OT

- Experience / Tradition / Reason / Scripture
  1. We are often unaware of our presuppositions as a fish is unaware of the water it is immersed in
  2. It is difficult to change our assumptions which give order and meaning to our live, which form and shape our very beings

- Behold
  - When we behold a work of art, the art consumes us, and we leave our world for a moment and enter another realm

  > The biblical interpreter seeks to enter the mind and world of the original author _before_ the interpreter relates the text to his/her own world.
  <br/> Richard E. Palmer, _Hermeneutics_, 168.

- A magic glass

  > The two worlds come together so that the Scriptures are like a magic glass through which we look to see ourselves, each other, and our wold as they really are.
  <br/> James D. Smart, _The Strange Silence of the Bible_, 34.
