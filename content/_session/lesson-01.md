## Galilee of the Gentiles (Matthew 4)

- Jesus withdrew to Galilee to fulfill prophesy

  - darkness -> light
  - death -> dawned

- Repent -> kingdom comes near near

  Jesus Preached the kingdom of God

- Jesus was _walking_

  - "fish for the people"
  - "At once they left" (Galileans independent)
  - v.21 "immediately they left"

- Jesus walked throughout the Galilee

  - Spread throughout Syria
  - Decapolis (Federation of 10 cities)
  - Jerusalem & Judea (reversal, they have to go back to Galilee)

## Discussion Questions

1. Introduction: What did you find most eye-opening about the lectures on Matthew, and what do you want to further discuss or ask?

2. Why in Matthew 1, after the genealogies (that show Jesus as descendant of Jews), do we have Gentiles from another religion worshiping Jesus and Jewish leaders disturbed (2:1-3)? Why not the other way around?

   - Outsider/insider disparity
   - Power corrupts (social & political power) &mdash; fear of losing power
   - Link between Herod & all Jerusalem were disturbed
   - Threatened by new "King of the Jew"

   - <samp>City of Peace is disturbed because people know the balance of power is shifting</samp>

3. > It is the pagan elite who now stand on the side of Jesus and act in keeping with biblical prophecies, while the elite of the holy people of Israel stand on the opposite side and begin a truly evil game against him.

   > (Luz 27, on 2:1-7)

   What does this response mean for leaders then, for people of other religions, and for us today?

   - Pagan / heathen - "What was lost is now found" (referred to Zacchaeus not to the whole people)
     - God wants to bless the Magi
     - Focus on relation
   - Magi - naive, they knew only enough to seek Jesus
   - <samp>The pagan elite found a figure of power (Jesus) in their corner</samp>

4. Why does the birth of the prince of peace (“God with us” 1:23) cause violence from the outset (2:13 and 2:16-18)? How is it possible for peace to produce violence?

   - <samp>Because the people of the City of Peace has not come under the Prince of Peace. Being within Jerusalem does not bring peace, but under Jesus' authority.</samp>

6. What is the reason for Matthew's preoccupation with Galilee and his unique introduction of Jesus in “Galilee of the Gentiles.” Discuss what this means in terms of margin-center dynamics (including light and darkness, prejudice and acceptance) in Jesus’ day and the kind of transformations it requires.

7. Regarding the question above, what specific old and new dynamics in the church cause tension between the older and younger generations?

   - How can the shepherds be more loving to the sheep, and the sheep to the shepherds?

   - Who are the insiders of the church and who are the outsiders? Since Jesus reversed the insiders and outsiders, what changes must we make in Christian circles?
