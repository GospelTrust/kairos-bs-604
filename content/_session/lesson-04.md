## Discussion Questions

1. Why do you think Jesus stays on the theme of the question of the lawyer, “What must I do to have eternal life,” and tells the parable of the Good Samaritan that focuses on doing, and concludes by declaring, “Do this and you will live.” Why do you think, in this case, Jesus does not talk to the lawyer about the role of faith in eternal life? (Luke 10:25-37)

2. What is the significance of, after bandaging and dressing, the man’s wounds, he “put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him” then returned the next day, and gave the innkeeper two denarii (equivalent of two days work), stating, “Look after him and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have” (10:34-35)?

3. <samp>During zoom we will be studying another parable in breakout groups. Best to approach it cold so I will declare that parable during the zoom session.</samp>

4. What are the surprises, ironies, ambiguities of the account of Jesus and the sinful woman at the home of a Pharisee. Who is in character and out of character?

   Who does the talking and who does not? What might be the reason?

   Who do you identify with most in the story and why?

5. Write down how you might apply leadership principles of Jesus (as exemplified in the feeding of 5000 in Luke 9:10-17) specifically in your ministry setting.

6. What are the many ways that Jesus declared (verbally and nonverbally) the upside down kingdom when he entered into Jerusalem and why did he not silence his disciples?

   How should Jesus’ example impact the way we conduct church and ministry today? (Luke 19:28-47)

7. Reflect on Jesus’ comments about the poor widow’s offering. What does this say about Jesus’ view of money and kingdom economics? (Luke 21:1-4).

   If you were to give a seminar on stewardship and offerings based on these verses, what would be the focus of your seminar, in a few sentences?
