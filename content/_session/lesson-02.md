## Discussion Questions

1. Regarding Matthew's thesis,

   > Every student of the Scriptures who becomes a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like someone who brings out new and old treasures from the storeroom (13:52)

   - what specific old and new dynamics in the church cause tension between the older and younger generations?

2. How can the shepherds be more loving to the sheep, and the sheep to the shepherds?

3. Who are the insiders of the church and who are the outsiders? Since Jesus reversed the insiders and outsiders, what changes must we make in Christian circles?

After discussing these issues, we will move into Jewish and Gentile, progressing themes, and how that relates to multicultural and intercultural issues. That will lead us to the great commission that focuses on discipleship, but includes the important participles of going, teaching, baptizing and culminates with marginal people sent to the margins and women playing a vital role.

Finally, we need to wrap our head around this idea that Bruner mentions in his commentary on the great commission, stating that a church that is not a mission church is not the church of Jesus Christ. What does that mean and how does that challenge or change the church.
