For quiz #2, focus on the following portions of your book by [Wenham/Walton]:

- Read Chapter 1
  - skip chart on p. 8-9

- Read Chapter 4
  - skip p. 68-73
  - skip p. 80-83...
  - Read carefully p. 85, especially what Dunn says

- Read Chapter 11 (all).

About 1/3 of your quiz will be on the readings and about 2/3 on the lectures.

My article on the Jubilee Mission of Jesus in Luke is only necessary if you want to review the material in the lecture and go deeper with it.  It's up to you whether you read it.
