<sub>Chapter 4</sub>
### Where did the Gospels come from?

- how scholars analyze the processes by which the Gospels were composed
- how to use a Gospels synopsis as a tool to study the Gospels for yourself

#### Luke 1:1-4

> 1 Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things that have been accomplished among us, 2 just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word have delivered them to us, 3 it seemed good to me also, having followed all things closely for some time past, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, 4 that you may have certainty concerning the things you have been taught.

- Oldest source is eyewitness testimony (v. 2)
- Source criticism
  - Agreements - how they tell a story (same words, closeness, copy?)
  - Agreement in the sequence of the stories
  - Differences of wording
  - Differences of sequence

- The "two source" hypothesis. Q (German Quelle, meaning "source") which Mark did not have access.

  ![two-source]

- Markan priority
  1. Length - shortest 661 verses
     - 601 parallel in Mathew and/or Luke
     - 97% words found in Matthew
     - 88% words found in Luke
     - Mark stresses Jesus' teaching and activities, resurrection account
     - Can't be abridgement of other gospels because of the greater details
  2. Agreements in the sequence of stories
     - Mark + Matthew against Luke
     - Mark + Luke against Matthew
     - Matthew + Luke never agree in order against Mark
  3. Grammar & style
     - Rougher, working in Greek as 2nd language
     - Mt & Lk has smoother style
     - Uses Aramaic words which others omit
     - Uses slang for "bed" (Greek _krabatton_ 2:4), Mt & Lk uses refined terms (_klines_ Mt 9:2; _klinidion_ Lk 5:19)
     - Makes more sense that Lk & Mt changes Mark rather than the other way around
  4. "Harder" wordings
     - Limits Jesus' power & influence
     - 1:34 Jesus heals "many" whereas Mt 8:16 & Lk 4:40 "all" or "every one of them"
     - 6:5f "could not" whereas Mt 13:58 "did not" because of unbelief suggests Jesus could but chose not to
     - 10:14 "Indignant" with them (James & John) but Mt 20:20 has their mother asked, "cover" some of the disciples' failings?
  5. Theology
     - Matthew uses "Lord" more to heightened Christology

- Q (_Quelle_ in German)

  235 verses which Matthew & Luke share and Mark does not have

  1. Agreements in wording

     John the Baptist's preaching Mt 3:7-10 & Lk 3:7-9
  2. Agreements in sequence
  3. "Doublets"

     Triplets those who have will receive more (Mt 13:12; Mk 4:25; Lk 8:18)

     - The Beatitudes
     - The Salt of the earth
     - The Light of the world
     - The Law and prophets
     - On Reconciliation
     - On Adultery and divorce
     - On Retaliation
     - On Love for enemies
     - The Lord's prayer
     - On treasure in heaven
     - Good eyes
     - On serving two masters
     - On anxiety
     - On judging others
     - On answers to prayer
     - The golden rule
     - The two ways
     - A tree and its fruit
     - Obedience, not words only
     - The two builders
  4. Coherence

     Q material forms a coherent body with quite a consistent theological perspective

- Criticisms of the two source hypothesis
  - Relationships are not straightforward, data doesn't fit neatly in the two source hypothesis
  - Priority of Mark, omission of the substantial section (Mk 6:45-8:26) by Luke is surprising (giving closely following sequence)
  - Matthew & Luke agree in wording against Mark (Mt 3:11f; Mk 1:7f; Lk 3:16-18) harder to explain, meaning Matthew & Luke independently changed Mark's phrase to exactly different phrase
  - Mark Goodacre criticizes parallel between Q and Gospel of Thomas
    - Q is better explained by Farrer-Goulder view that Mark writes first, Luke writes last, using both Mark & Matthew

      - Mark → Matthew → Luke
      - Mark → Luke

    - Speculations that there might be multiple "editions" of Q because of inconsistent doublets (Lk 19:12-27 cf. Mt 25:14-30)
    - Stories appear in both Mark & Q (overlap)
      - John the Baptist
      - Temptation of Jesus
      - Jesus colluded with Satan
      - Mustard seed
      - Commissioning the disciples
    - Exact wordings of these stories. Mark & Q agree verbatim in 50 verses. Harder to conclude that Q is an independent source (is it Mark?)

- The Griesbach (or "two Gospels") hypothesis
  - W.R Farmer → Matthew wrote first, then Luke used Matthew and Mark made a short version of the two longer Gospels (originated from J.J. Griesbach)

    - Matthew → Luke → Mark
    - Matthew → Mark

  - Early testimony

    Irenaeus, Eusebius & Augustine consider Matthew to be the first Gospel
  - Matthew's Jewishness

    Assumes washing customs because predominantly Jewish until became more Gentile
  - Agreements in order and wording
    - If Mt & Mk agree against Lk, Mk has followed Mt rather than Lk
    - If Lk & Mk agree against Mt, Mk has followed Lk rather than Mt
    - If Mt & Lk agree against Mk, Mk deviates from both of his sources
  - Markan redundancies
    - Over 200 places in Mark
    - Incorporating both phrases
  - The "minor agreements"
