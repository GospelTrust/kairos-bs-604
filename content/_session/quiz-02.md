### Where did the Gospels come from?

- how scholars analyze the processes by which the Gospels were composed
- how to use a Gospels synopsis as a tool to study the Gospels for yourself

#### Luke 1:1-4

> 1 Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things that have been accomplished among us, 2 just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word have delivered them to us, 3 it seemed good to me also, having followed all things closely for some time past, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, 4 that you may have certainty concerning the things you have been taught.

- Oldest source is eyewitness testimony (v. 2)
- Source criticism
  - Agreements - how they tell a story (same words, closeness, copy?)
  - Agreement in the sequence of the stories
