## Discussion Questions

1. What are the many ways that Jesus declared (verbally and nonverbally) the upside-down kingdom when he entered into Jerusalem and why did he not silence his disciples?

   How should Jesus' upside-down example impact/change the way we conduct church and ministry today? (Luke 19:28-47)

2. Reflect on the meaning of Jesus driving out the people selling in the temple and adding, “My house will be a house of prayer”...not...”a den of robbers” (Luke 19: 45-46).

   If Jesus were to show up to the church today and visibly assert his authority, what would he do and say (whether related to money, prayer, or something else)?

3. Reflect on Jesus’ comments about the poor widow’s offering. What does this say about Jesus’ view of money and kingdom economics? (Luke 21:1-4).

   If you were to give a seminar on stewardship and offerings based on these verses, what would be the focus of your seminar, in a few sentences?

4. Jesus depicts himself as a true benefactor (a kind helper) and contemporary leaders as false benefactors (lording it over others). For Jesus, the true sign of authority is through genuine servanthood.

   Jesus resists any form and language of "servanthood" that serves oneself in order to control others (22:24-27).

   Give an example of when you have seen servanthood at its best and when you’ve seen it as self-serving.

5. We live in a violent world. If a disciple of Christ came to you today ready to engage in violence because of 22:35-38, where the disciples produced two swords, how would you respond?

6. List the various non-verbal manifestations of God’s authority–and their meanings–at Jesus’ crucifixion (Luke 23:38-49).
