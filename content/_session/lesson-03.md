## Discussion Questions

1. Why do you think John gave specific fruits of repentance, during baptism, to various groups of people (Luke 3:7-14)?

   How might we apply this today?

2. What was the focus of Mary’s Magnificat (Luke 1:46-55)?

   How might it relate to John’s declaration about mountains, valleys, crooked, straight (Luke 3:5-6)?

   How does Jesus incorporate Mary’s and John’s themes in his jubilee synagogue sermon (Luke 4:18-29) and in his first beatitude and woe (Luke 6:20,24)?

   How do all of these strengthen understanding of Jesus’ sermon?

3. Discuss the four changes that take place at Jubilee. How are each of the four aspects relevant in Jesus’ day?

   Express in your words how they are relevant in contemporary society today?

4. How might the church find ways to put Jubilee into practice (in your opinion)?

5. Since Jubilee was never put into practice but mandated by God every 50 years (Lev. 25:8-10ff; cf. Isaiah 61:1-2, Luke 4:19), why do you think it has not been put into practice? (Although your professor gave his opinion you might have your own opinion).

   Do you feel the early church was influenced by Jubilee in Acts 2:42-47 and 4:32-37?

   Speaking of those scriptures in Acts, which of these attributes of the early church have you seen and not seen practiced in the contemporary church, and why?

6. Discuss the possibility of Jesus having a specific economic strategy to change the economic system of his day and flow resources from rich to poor. Discuss some teachings, parables, or narratives that might support this claim. Then express why you think Jesus had a strategy or not.
